Alice woke up at 3am took a cold shower and then went back to sleep on a summer night. But it was still too hot so she couldn't sleep.
She kept on changing her sleeping position over and over again and before she noticed it was 7am and the sun started to rise making the weather even hotter.
She screamed as she got out of bed, I didn't even get a wink of sleep.'
Sad and sleepy she had to go to school on top of it. So she got ready and went to school in a really bad mood.
